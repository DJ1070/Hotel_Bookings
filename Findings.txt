Surprise:

1. Distribution Channel has some impact on the cancellation rate.

2. Deposit type plays a huge role in cancellation behavior (but also in lead time) - more so in city hotels!

3. What does a feature importance value of -5 mean? -> adr

4. Is there no Kappa and Feature Importance for K-fold Decision Tree?

6. train test split: does the random state have an influence on the results? Repeating the same random state seems so...
